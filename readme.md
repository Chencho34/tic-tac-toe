# Tic-tac-toe

## Project Create With React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Description

This implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game has been developed using ReactJS. It offers a complete gaming experience with basic game functionality, allowing players to compete to check three consecutive boxes. Additionally, it has an additional feature that makes use of the Canvas Confetti library, adding a confetti effect at the end of the game when a player wins. Game progress is saved locally using Local Storage so players can resume previous games. The design has been created with CSS3 and advanced React concepts have been implemented, including the use of reusable components.
